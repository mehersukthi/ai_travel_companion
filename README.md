## Inspiration
Inspired by dating apps and social networking platforms designed for travelers, we saw an opportunity to create a more intelligent and personalized travel companion that combines social connection with AI-driven recommendations.

## What it does
1. Personalized Destination Recommendations:
The app leverages AI to analyze user preferences, past travel experiences, and interests to suggest tailored destinations. It considers multiple factors including climate, cultural attractions, travel restrictions, and seasonal events to provide highly relevant recommendations.

2. Dynamic Itinerary Planning:
Users input their travel dates, interests, and budget to receive AI-generated personalized itineraries. The system suggests activities, landmarks, dining options, and local events while optimizing for logistics and time management. The app features real-time adjustments based on weather changes, user feedback, or unexpected events, ensuring travelers can adapt quickly to changing circumstances.

3. Social and Community Features:
The app facilitates connections between travelers through interest-based matching and location awareness. Users can share tips, reviews, and experiences, while the app suggests potential meetups or group activities based on shared interests and travel dates, creating an engaging community of global travelers.
